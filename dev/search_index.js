A basis set in theoretical and computational chemistry is a set of functions (called basis functions) that is used to represent the  electronic wave function in the Hartree–Fock method or density-functional theory in order to turn the partial differential equations  of the model into algebraic equations suitable for efficient implementation on a computer. The use of basis sets is equivalent to the  use of an approximate resolution of the identity: the orbitals vert psi_i rangle are expanded within the basis set as a linear combination of the basis functions vert psi_i rangle approx sum_mu  c_mu i vert mu rangle,  where the expansion coefficients c_mu i are given by c_mu i = sum_nu  langle mu vert nu rangle^-1  langle nu vert psi_i rangle. The basis set can either be composed of atomic orbitals (yielding the linear combination of  atomic orbitals approach), which is the usual choice within the quantum chemistry community; plane waves which are typically used within  the solid state community, or real-space approaches. Several types of atomic orbitals can be used: Gaussian-type orbitals, Slater-type  orbitals, or numerical atomic orbitals. Out of the three, Gaussian-type orbitals are by far the most often used, as they allow efficient  implementations of Post-Hartree–Fock methods. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Foca.jl:-An-application-for-Computational-Chemists","page":"Home","title":"Foca.jl: An application for Computational Chemists","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: HartreeFoca jl)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: Issues) (Image: Build Status) (Image: Commit Activity)","category":"page"},{"location":"#Overview","page":"Home","title":"Overview","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To install the package, you will call the Julia Package Manager on your REPL:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"]add Foca","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Done!
